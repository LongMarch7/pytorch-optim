    "Up to this point we have updated the weights of our models by manually mutating the Tensors holding learnable parameters (with `torch.no_grad()` or `.data` to avoid tracking history in `autograd`). This is not a huge burden for simple optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent, but in practice we often train neural networks using more sophisticated optimizers like AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam, etc.\n",
